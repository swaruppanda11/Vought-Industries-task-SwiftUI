## Transforming Vought Showcase into a Story Viewer

This is my attempt to do the task in SwiftUI. I tried to do implement the same functionality and added the following bonus points as given in the task document - 

1. Implementation using SwiftUI
2. Adherence to SOLID principles
3. Addition of an intermediate view controller with a button that:
4. Opens CarouselViewController with a bottom-up animation
5. Closes the view controller when the user swipes down or all members have been shown - added a cross button to dismiss the story view
